An easy example of how to use configurator.
For the example we will use the agent.xml file.

First of all u must construct the key for the value that u want:

first part of the key is the file without the .xml string
so first part is: agents

next with the use of the "." seperator u can move to a child node, for example to a statechart:
so now the key is: agents.statechart

It is possible to have multiple nodes with the same name, you can select ammong them with the use of the "~" seperator:
so if you have the key: agents.agent~1, you querry the xmlmanager to return the second appearance of a node (with respect of the appearance in the xml file)

If you want to take the value of an attribute you must use the "$" seperator
so with the key: agents.agent.$Priority, you querry the xmlmanager to return from the first agent node the priority attribute

------------------------------- Examples --------------------------------------------
You can get the number of all the agent node in the file with the following command:
_cfg.numberOfNodesForKey("agents.agent")

Now for a given agent node u can take the number of activities:
_cfg.numberOfNodesForKey("agents.agent~2.activity")

You can access the value of a specific activity node:
_cfg.findValueForKey("agents.agent~1.activity~2").at(0)

With the same function call u can get the value of attribute:
_cfg.findValueForKey("agents.agent~1.$Priority").at(0)
