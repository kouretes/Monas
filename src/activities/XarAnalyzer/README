For the right use of the activity XarAnalyzer!

With this activity you can record one special action from a xar file and create a kme file with the same angles of the special action.

For every new special action you have to set:

	at XarAnalyzer.h
1)ACTION_TIME of your motion (INTEGER)

	at XarAnalyzer.cpp
1)in the function Execute() the name of your motion
2)in the function createKmeFile() the name of your new motion for the kme file

	at agents.xml
1)put the line 	<activity>XarAnalyzer</activity>  at the agent KSensors
2)put comments at the agent KVision

	at MotionController (optional)
1)for better recording you can change the motion "PenalizedZeroPos.xar" to "InitPose.xar" in the function mglrun()

Also for much better recording you can hold the robot in the air!
