If you are reading these lines, it means that you have successfully created 
a clone of the Kouretes-Noxious 2011 code from the Monas repository. 

BUILD

- Create a folder named build under Monad/make

- Enter folder build

- Execute: cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path to naoqi sdk>/toolchain-pc.cmake ../..

- Execute: ccmake .

- Change TargetPlatform to robot

- Press c to configure

- Check the values of KROBOT_IS_REMOTE, TargetPlatform, NaoQiVersion, RobotPlatform (if applicable)

  KROBOT_IS_REMOTE is ON, a library is produced, otherwise an executable is produced. 
  NaoQiversion should be the latest. 
  RobotPlatform must be Nao.
  
- Press c to configure again, then g to generate and exit. 

- Execute: make -jk install, where k is the number of cores in your system. 

- Get a coffee and be patient ... 


CROSSBUILD 

- Create a folder named crossbuild under Monad/make

- Enter folder crossbuild

- Execute: cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path to naoqi sdk>/toolchain-geode.cmake ../..

- Execute: ccmake .

- Change TargetPlatform to robot

- Press c to configure

- Check the values of KROBOT_IS_REMOTE, NaoQiVersion, RobotPlatform 

  KROBOT_IS_REMOTE is ON, a library is produced, otherwise an executable is produced. 
  NaoQiversion should be the latest. 
  RobotPlatform must be Nao.

- Real-time execution for the nao requires the code to be compiled as a shared object at the moment.

- Press c to configure again, then g to generate and exit. 

- Execute: make -jk install, where k is the number of cores in your system. 

- Get another coffee and be even more patient ... 


Use the python scripts in the script directory to upload the code to a robot.
To do so , you need a valid config directory in /home/nao/naoqi/ (on the robot)
and a valid autoload.ini in /home/nao/naoqi/preferences/autoload.ini (again, on the robot)
to start the krobot module.

That's all! Enjoy!
